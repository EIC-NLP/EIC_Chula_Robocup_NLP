# Guide for Beginners

For beginners section is essential to fully utilize all this repository has to offer

## For Beginners, for using

**Start with Basics** : Understand basic Python syntax and concepts.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** : Learn about classes and objects in Python.

**Network Programming** : Look into HTTPS server hosting for an understanding of network communications. We use Flask for hosting with Python

**Rasa NLP Framework** : The rasa directory suggests the use of Rasa for natural language processing, which is a powerful tool for building chatbots and voice assistants.

**Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS)** : Files like stt_whisper.py, tts_azure.py, and tts_mimic_bridge.py indicate the use of speech recognition and synthesis technologies.

**Github Issue** : for posting any problems you have encountered on the main respository.

## For Intermediate, for writing and contributing

**Pytorch with GPU Acceleration** :

**Github Pull Request** :

## For Advance, for competing

**State Machines** : Useful for robotics and automation logic.

**State Class** : The MoveTo class is a state in a state machine, inheriting from smach.State.

**ROS (Robot Operating System)** : If interested in robotics, ROS is a valuable framework to learn.

**Execution Logic** : The execute method contains the logic that is run when the state is active. It includes decision-making based on input data.
\*\*This file is a good example of how OOP can be used to structure complex logic, like a state machine, in a readable and maintainable way. visu
